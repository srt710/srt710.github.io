      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Imagine if you will, that you are a macbook user (sorry Apple) living in a rural area. Your device breaks but the closest Apple store is in the main city 5+ hours away. You have an important work deadline and so you contact the Apple store in the main city. The staff at the store explain to you that repairing your macbook will cost more than the device’s current market value and recommend you purchase a new macbook. Not being satisfied with this answer you decide to visit the computer store in the neighboring town. The staff at the computer store notify you that even though they are technically capable of repairing your macbook they are unable to legally purchase the necessary parts or receive technical documentation from Apple.</p>
<p>Scenarios like this one have led to a political movement over the consumer’s right to repair. What it comes down to in summary is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you own a device you should have the right to obtain replacement parts and service documentation for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="legal-issues-surrounding-right-to-repair">Legal Issues Surrounding Right to Repair:</h2>
<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property:</h3>
<p>Manufacturers will argue that their intellectual property rights are being infringed when these services are offered. If the service manuals and parts are easily available then one could potentially create an iPhone using a Samsung chasis and an LG battery. Another example could be somebody starting a business building custom webcams using the camera of a smartphone or laptop. The manufacturer&rsquo;s intellectual property has now been infringed becuse a new product has been developed using their product.</p>
<h3 id="customer-safety">Customer Safety:</h3>
<p>Another argument that opponents of right to repair legislation will use is customer safety. If any individual can &ldquo;repair&rdquo; their device and something goes wrong it will impact the manufacturer&rsquo;s reputation. Lets say you get your Samsung battery replaced at Bob&rsquo;s phone store and the phone proceeds to catch on fire while charging, you go after Bob who then proceeds to go after Samsung who provided him with the replacement battery in the first place. Manufacturers would rather avoid this headache all together and just provide you a replacement device (within the waranty period) or offer you a discount towards a new device.</p>
<h2 id="ethical-issues-surrounding-right-to-repair">Ethical Issues Surrounding Right to Repair:</h2>
<h3 id="counterfeit-devices-and-third-party-components">Counterfeit Devices and Third Party Components:</h3>
<p><img src="/img/ifixit-iphone-6.jpg" alt="IFIXIT Replacement Battery"></p>
<p>Some opponents of right to repair legislation will also argue that it will make counterfeit devices easier to make. You could for example purchase a replacement iPhone chasis but fill it with fake components in an attempt to scam unsuspecting customers. I would also argue that there is also the issue of third party components in the current system. By not making the replacement parts available we push tech savvy people into buying third party components to complete repairs which may or may not match the manufacturer&rsquo;s quality standards.</p>
<h3 id="unfair-business-practices">Unfair Business Practices</h3>
<p>Supporters of right to repair legislation will argue that manufacturers are being unfair to the customer by not enabling third party repair services. In our introduction scenario for example the average consumer has no choice to either pay the manufacturer a large sum of money (greater than the market value of the device) or lose their files. If the manufactuer supported right to repair then the customer can at least have a technician attempt to repair their device (at their own risk) which will save the customer from buying a new device. Right to repair could also revive a dying repair industry which is good for the public. Some opponents might argue that it is bad for their business to also provide replacement parts and service manuals, to those individuals I would point to Dell and Lenovo who have always offered replacement parts for their devices as well as service manuals. In fact most repair shops I have ever visited are full of Lenovo and Dell machines for this exact reason.</p>
<h3 id="environmental-impacts--consumer-protection">Environmental Impacts &amp; Consumer Protection:</h3>
<p>In our introduction scenario what happens to the broken macbook if the customer decides to buy a new one? It goes into &ldquo;E-Waste&rdquo; where it is shipped to countries with cheap labor (such as Ghana) who extract all plastic components so the circut board components can be melted and extracted of their precious metals (including gold).</p>
<p><img src="/img/e-waste.jpg" alt="E-Waste in Ghana"></p>
<p>In some cases the items being thrown out have either minor issues or no issues at all. Even if we discount the waste issue there is also the issue of having to manufacture more and more devices which increases our carbon footprint. The best thing we can do for the environment is use our products until they are unusable. The right to repair movement also empowers a new industry where businesses could purchase devices with defects and repair them similar to the refurbished pc / laptop market.</p>
<h2 id="right-to-repair-legislation">Right to Repair Legislation</h2>
<p>In 2019, Canada for the first time introduced repairs bills and it was all about a Canadian politician’s daughter who broke her smartphone and her dad realized that Samsung charged him more than a brand new phone only for repairing.</p>
<p>In Europe their legislation is called the Eco Design Directive and it forces manufacturers to provide spares parts for common appliances for up to ten years.</p>
<p>In the US two presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were supporting  the right to repair as part of their agricultural program, which it allows farmers to fix their John Deere tractors.</p>
<p>Congress of the US has been working on apples anti-competitive repair behaviour which brought up a restriction for a third-party repair</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article I spoke mainly about phones and laptops, however the right to repair movement is much larger than that. At this point every device has electronics inside of it from home appliances to tractors and other industrial equipment. And users want the ability to fix their devices rather than purchase a new one or wait for authorized service. For example the right to repair movement has farmers battling John Deere over getting access to the service software so they can fix their own tractors. Some farmers have even resorted to using third party firmware from eastern europe because they can&rsquo;t afford to wait for John Deere to send a service technician.</p>
